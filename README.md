# LVISF2-R-processing
This repository contains links to download two LVIS F2 Level-2 Geolocated Surface Elevation and Canopy Height acquisitions in the `_input` folder for processing. In practice, any number of LVIS ASCII text files can be processed. The R script `LVIS_to_raster.R` contains annotated code to iteratively read each text file in the `_input` folder and generate projected raster (.tif) and vector (.shp) files. The user can specify the desired spatial projection and spatial resolution for the raster output, as well as the height fields which will write as individual .tif layers. The vector output projects the LVIS samples as points and generates a 5m buffer to correspond with the 10m footprint of the LVIS instrument. All metadata and height statistics are retained as attributes in the resulting shapefile. (Note that only the raster outputs are included in the `outputs` folder due to the large size of the shapefiles.)
